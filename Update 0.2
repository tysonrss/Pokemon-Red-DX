0x93F88 - new repointed names for map
0x92382 - 0x92439 - Text Pointers and Areas (Johto) have been edited to match Kanto[R/B/Y]

Town Map has been edited to resemble old Kanto, there is no Pokemon Tower or S.S Anne on the map because of lack of space.

All Johto maps have been moved to the "SPECIAL" Map Bank.

All Kanto maps have been moved over to the Johto map table to match the new town map place locations.

Johto wild data must be replaced with Kanto wild data as well as fly positions[repointed]. tysonrss will do this.
